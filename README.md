# UNP_PYTHON_STUDENT_SALARY
Overview:
This project focuses on developing a predictive model to estimate student salaries, helping guide career planning and decision-making. It explores various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, to identify the most effective technique for accurate salary predictions.

Objective:
The primary objective is to determine the best-performing machine learning model for predicting student salaries, enabling students to make informed decisions about career development and salary expectations.

Key Findings:

	•	Machine learning models were evaluated for their performance in predicting student salaries.
	•	The Random Forest model outperformed other algorithms, demonstrating superior accuracy and reliability in salary predictions.
